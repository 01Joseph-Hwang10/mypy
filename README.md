# mypy

## Todo

- Copy and paste .pyz file with user id, executing datetime appended at the file name.

- Do the same thing at input, data, output, log. Think about how to deal with it.

- In the case of \_\_args.py, append user id at the name. Same at log and output. You would need to change create app view accordingly.
